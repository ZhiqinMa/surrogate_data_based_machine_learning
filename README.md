# Predicting critical transitions with surrogate data-based machine learning

This repository contains code to accompany the publication


## Requirements

Requires Python 3.7 or later to compute early warning signals (EWS). To install python package dependencies, use the command

```bash
conda create surr_ews python=3.9
conda activate surr_ews
pip install -r requirements_surr_ews.txt
```
within a new virtual environment.

Python 3.6 and MATLAB 2018b are required to generate surrogate data. To install python package dependencies, use the command

```bash
conda create -n surr_mat python=3.8
conda activate surr_mat
pip install -r requirements_surr_mat.txt
```

The Versions of Python and MATLAB have a one-to-one correspondence, otherwise the connection cannot be established, see below for the correspondence: [Versions of Python Compatible with MATLAB Products by Release - MATLAB & Simulink (mathworks.cn)](https://ww2.mathworks.cn/support/requirements/python-compatibility.html)

## Workflow

The results in the paper are obtained from the following workflow:

1. **Pre-process data**. Codes to process the data are available in the directory `./01_data_preprocessing/01_organise__transition__ews/.` Residuals are obtained and variance and lag-1 autocorrelation are computed.

2. **Generate the training data**. We used five different surrogate methods to generate surrogate data with different sample sizes as training data. Note: we are running from the command line interface of the Git software installation. Run

   ```bash
   conda activate surr_mat
   bash ./01_data_preprocessing/02_extracte_and_generate_surrogate_dataset/code/run_all_script.sh | tee oe_run_all_script.log
   ```

   where generate the training data save: `./02_extracte_and_generate_surrogate_dataset/data`. Due to the large size of the generated surrogate datasets, the data was deleted before being pushed to `GitHub`. The final compressed output is 27.5GB for the whole project. This dataset is archived on `Zenodo` at [Predicting critical transitions with surrogate data-based machine learning: Project (zenodo.org)](https://zenodo.org/records/12562316).

3. **Train the surrogate data-based machine learning  (SDML) classifiers, Generate SDML predictions, and Compute ROC statistics.** Results reported in the paper take the average prediction from these 10 networks. Note: we are running from the command line interface of the Git software installation. Run 

   ```bash
   conda activate surr_ews
   bash ./02_train_predicate_model/xxx_ml/run_all_script_ml.sh | tee oe_run_all_script_ml.log
   bash ./02_train_predicate_model/xxx_dl/run_all_script_dl.sh | tee oe_run_all_script_dl.log
   ```

   The training models and result data, which are large in volume, were deleted before being pushed to `GitHub`. This dataset is archived on `Zenodo` at [https://zenodo.org/records/12562316](https://zenodo.org/records/12562316).
